                    <h2 class="section-heading">In favor of Net Neutrality</h2>

                    <p>The Internet has become so ingrained in the everyday life of Americans that the administration should adopt rules that maintain the Internet as fundamental infrastructure, rather than a limited service. Broadband wires and networks are the modern-day equivalent of phone lines of the early 20th century, so they should be regulated as such [<a href="links.html#1">1</a>]. The Internet is not a form of property that belongs to Internet Service Providers, and ISPs do not have the right to determine who can receive preferred access. If the FCC is unable to enforce net neutrality, the Internet could turn into a patchwork of fiefdoms, with untold ripple effects [<a href="links.html#1">1</a>]. Allowing large companies to exercise control over the Internet harms innovation and freedom of speech. Failing to ban ISPs from discriminating against certain companies makes it harder for tech entrepreneurs to compete, because the costs of entry would rise and ISPs could seek to hobble service for competitors unwilling or unable to pay special access fees [<a href="links.html#7">7</a>]. Small businesses would be placed at a disadvantage and innovation would stall because newer ideas would not be able to gain traction with users. Furthermore, ISPs would be able to act as “tollkeepers” and use their pricing to control what content is available over the Internet [<a href="links.html#7">7</a>].</p>

                    <p>The counterarguments for net neutrality are not logically sound. Some believe that regulating net neutrality is unnecessary because market competition ensures that companies act in their customers’ best interests. However, no true competition exists because users rarely switch services due to penalties and local cable monopolies that control over two-thirds of the market [<a href="links.html#2">2</a>]. Other skeptics of net neutrality propose that simply requiring companies to disclose their technical discrimination policies would be enough to ensure equal competition. However, the absence of direct policies against discrimination does not prevent anyone from breaking the rules.</p>

                    <p>Ultimately, net neutrality preserves the values of the Internet: human and political rights, creativity, and innovation [<a href="links.html#2">2</a>]. The Internet was built to be an open resource for all, and access should not be decided by ISPs that seek to make profit. Instead, net neutrality needs to both be enforced effectively and defined clearly by the FCC so that there truly is equality across the Internet.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Against Net Neutrality</h2>

                    <p>One of the primary arguments against net neutrality is that there exist technical complexities in altering the Internet’s infrastructure.</p>

                    <blockquote>“There’s a lot of complexity here at a technical level that is absolutely lost in the policy conversations,” says Fred Baker, a distinguished engineering fellow at Cisco Systems and former chair of the Internet Engineering Task Force [<a href="links.html#6">6</a>].</blockquote>

                    <p>One such difficult task is managing the diverse traffic, which includes traffic that the Internet was never meant to handle. Internet packet switching was designed for digital file transfers, such as for email and web pages, that do not have to be delivered in specific order. However, today’s fixed broadband networks are able to transmit voice and video that must be delivered quickly and in a specific sequence. As a result, networks cannot afford to miss a packet and thus must deal with internal congestion. Engineers currently deal with traffic flow by labeling each packet with codes based on the time sensitivity of the data, which the routes can then use to schedule transmission [<a href="links.html#6">6</a>]. These codes are ingrained in the infrastructure of the Internet. Net neutrality would strip away this code system and deem all data packets equal, which would cause a severe decrease in quality and a higher risk of network congestion [<a href="links.html#6">6</a>].</p>

                    <p>Furthermore, the nature of traffic management demands that some data must be delayed in favor of others [<a href="links.html#4">4</a>]. For example, treating all Internet traffic equally means that hospitals would not be able to choose an ISP that favors traffic from a patient's heart monitor over traffic from file transfers. As a result, many net neutrality opponents favor a tiered Internet in which content providers are charged differently for different types of traffic. People opposed to net neutrality believe that hospitals should be able to pay a higher fee to make sure that their time-sensitive data is given preference. In general, a tiered Internet would restrict harmful traffic, support applications that send massive amounts of data, and allow consumers to stream video and share files at a fast rate.</p>

                    <p>Net neutrality also infringes upon the constitutional rights of ISPs. Transparency, a basic rule of net neutrality, violates broadband providers’ First Amendment rights by forcing them to transmit messages they do not want to convey. No blocking (another tenet of net neutrality) infringes upon Fourth Amendment rights because Internet Service Providers are forced to grant content providers an unrestricted right to occupy property, and are forbidden from exercising their right to control the use of their property. This results in subjecting ISPs to physical and regulatory takings [<a href="links.html#11">11</a>].</p>
