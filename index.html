                    <p>The Internet ushered in the Age of Information. Many have named it one of the most significant human inventions since the printing press. However, as the Internet approaches its 25th birthday, the United States government&mdash;as well as others around the world&mdash;continues to flounder in its efforts to appropriately regulate this paradigm-shifting technology. One of the more fundamental legislative questions brought up by the spread of the Internet is that of network neutrality: whether network operators should be allowed to inspect the data they deliver and alter its speed, reliability and price of Internet traffic based on its origin or contents. Carriers who transport physical packages are not allowed to discriminate in this way, but neither the United States nor Europe has definitively answered this question for telecom operators.</p>

                    <p>The fundamental goal of net neutrality is to prevent harmful data discrimination, but analysts throughout the political spectrum disagree on exactly what constitutes harmful discrimination. The most vocal supporters of net neutrality call for complete network blindness; organizations like the Electronic Frontier Foundation argue that any interference with the flow of information online is inherently immoral and destructive. Moderates argue that tiered service can sometimes improve the Internet experience for consumers, like smoothing out Skype calls at the expense of negligibly slower file downloads, or subsidizing mobile access to socially useful Wikipedia articles in rural areas where bandwidth is normally expensive. Skeptics argue that net neutrality is simply interference with the free market; they believe that Internet providers should be free to offer services as they see fit, and that excessive throttling will correct itself by causing an exodus of customers.</p>

                    <p>In the first decades of the Internet, net neutrality regulations did not exist--and were not really needed. Before the advent of streaming video and “<a href="terms.html#web_app">web applications</a>”, the Internet delivered mostly small snippets of text and occasional images. Network operators had no substantively different usage patterns to discriminate between. As the Internet grew, however, legislators’ concerns and providers’ motivation to throttle speed and bandwidth grew with it. The United States’ Federal Communications Commission (FCC) announced its support of net neutrality in 2005, and introduced the Open Internet Order (OIO) in 2010 to bring the principle into law. The OIO required providers to be fully transparent about their network management processes, and outlawed blocking and “unreasonable” discrimination in transmitting lawful content.</p>

                    <p>Similarly, the European Union introduced the Telecoms Package in 2009, which also did not enforce absolute non-discrimination, but instead established strict transparency requirements. The Package mandated that Internet service providers disclose all “traffic management techniques and their impact on service quality” clearly in every contract, as well as establish a “minimum quality of services” by limiting bandwidth caps and throttling speed [<a href="links.html#9">9</a>]. The European Parliament strengthened its net neutrality regulations in 2014 with an overwhelming vote (534 to 25) in favor of full neutrality. European service providers are now permitted to throttle traffic only when complying with a court order, preventing a denial of service attack on their infrastructure or temporary decongesting of their network [<a href="links.html#14">14</a>].</p>

                    <p>For a year following the EU’s adoption of full neutrality, the United States lagged behind. The Open Internet Order had failed to prevent network providers from abusing their “last mile monopoly.” As a result of ruthless negotiations between Comcast and Netflix that lasted for over two years, many users found streaming movies to be difficult or impossible until Netflix finally agreed to pay Comcast in exchange for prioritized bandwidth [<a href="links.html#10">10</a>]. In addition, a Washington, D.C. circuit court struck down the OIO, claiming that the FCC was improperly enforcing public utility rules on a telecom company. Over the following year, the FCC considered proposals for new legislation, and the net neutrality debate spread throughout the tech industry and the country at large. Largely in reaction to outspoken advocacy from individuals and companies throughout the technology industry, in February 2015 the FCC voted 3-2 in favor of officially classifying the Internet as a public utility and establishing service providers as common carriers under Title II. Telecom lobbyists have already encouraged Congress to introduce a bill called the “Internet Freedom Act” intended to overrule the FCC, but if the Commission’s vote is allowed to stand then the net neutrality issue will likely be settled permanently in the United States.</p>
