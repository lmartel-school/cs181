                    <p>Net neutrality presents interesting ethical considerations regarding the free market and open information access. The ethical dilemmas that net neutrality presents stem from the conflicting concerns and experiences of users, internet service providers (ISPs), and content providers. ISPs transport the data upon which many companies’ business models are based on and make profit from. Since they provide a vital and expensive infrastructure, Internet Service Providers feel they have the right to offer lucrative additional services like traffic prioritization to increase their profits. On the other hand, Internet users and content providers pay for a set data rate and thus feel they should not be restricted or charged more based on their usage. We will examine all sides of the situation through utilitarian and deontological perspectives. </p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Utilitarian</h2>

                    <p>The utilitarian perspective demands analysis of the effects on website and application providers, ISPs, and end users of websites and Internet applications. Utilitarianism is an ethical framework in which the ethical choice of action is the one that ultimately produces the greatest benefit for society. Utilitarians believe that the benefit of an action can be quantified thoroughly enough that a “most beneficial” choice can be determined. A utilitarian analysis centers around deciding which groups would ultimately benefit from the enforcement of net neutrality.</p>

                    <p>In a free market economy, fiduciary responsibility obligates businesses to pursue the course of action that will allow them to both continue doing business and also make the most profit [<a href="links.html">20</a>]. The scenario leading to the greatest benefit for ISPs would therefore be one in which businesses could charge “what they can from who they can” [<a href="links.html">16</a>]. For example, Amazon heavily prioritizes the speed of their website, estimating that an extra second of page load time would cost them $1.6 billion in sales each year [<a href="links.html">17</a>]. An ISP could extort huge amounts of money from a company like Amazon by threatening to throttle their checkout page. Without net neutrality, ISPs are free to profit from such tactics. ISPs would earn the most profit by charging a maximal price for each content provider then allocating bandwidth accordingly. However, the concept of net neutrality dictates that each content provider must receive the same priority, in which case big companies would no longer have an incentive to pay higher prices to ISPs. Therefore, complete net neutrality would cause ISPs to lose profit from potential business, since they could no longer allocate extra bandwidth for big companies willing to pay more. Thus ISPs would benefit the most in a world without net neutrality. However, this benefit does not trickle down to consumers.</p>

                    <p>On the other hand, net neutrality would lead to the greatest benefit for small or new companies and, arguably, end users as well. Today, much commerce occurs over the Internet; as a neutral network, the Internet allows competition and innovation to determine the success of a business. Without neutrality, ISPs have a much bigger impact on the Internet economy. Companies with slower load times&mdash;an effect of less priority bandwidth being available for their site&mdash;lose profit from impatient customers. Without the funds or corporate connections necessary to pay for prioritization, all Internet companies begin with a competitive disadvantage. Relatively large companies have the ability to pay for prioritization, while new and small businesses cannot afford those prices. A neutral Internet, where every company’s data receives the same priority, would level the Internet marketplace and allow innovation to determine the success of the entire market. A diverse marketplace for digital services allows consumers a wider range of choices, and keeps prices down through competition. For these reasons, the benefits that reasonable net neutrality laws provide for small businesses would also benefit consumers, who represent a much larger group than Comcast and Amazon shareholders combined.</p>

                    <p>Additionally, end users would also benefit directly from an Internet where they can decide how to allocate the bits for which they pay. End users pay ISPs a set price for a set data rate, so it is in the end users’ best interest to get as reliable and fast an Internet connection as possible. Without net neutrality, ISPs can throttle access to certain sites, since they have a say in how to allocate their bandwidth. Under throttling, end users cannot access all sites with the same ease (or even at all); during the aggressive 2014 negotiations between Comcast and Netflix, many consumers reported that the popular video streaming site became completely unusable. Many people in less populated areas of the United States only have access to one internet service provider [<a href="links.html">18</a>]. Without net neutrality, these users are forced to cooperate with any restrictions their local provider chooses to enforce, and therefore end users would benefit most from having a neutral Internet.</p>

                    <p>In summation, providing the most good for the most people with net neutrality requires the restriction of ISP operations, where ISPs would no longer have complete control over the use of their infrastructure. With the equal access offered by a neutral Internet, society would ultimately find  “a sustained innovation rate, open access to information and  democratization of the participation to the Internet” [<a href="links.html">13</a>]. A utilitarian ethical framework supports this choice, since it ultimately has the greatest positive impact on society.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Deontological</h2>

                    <p>In contrast to utilitarianism, the deontological ethical framework judges an action not by its effects, but by its intent. Rather than looking purely at the results of an action, deontology analyzes the purpose or objective of the person carrying out the action to judge whether that action is ethical. In contrast to utilitarianism, the ends never justify the means.</p>

                    <p>Companies may not be individuals, but it would seem that they should have some property rights to the infrastructure that they create. Therefore, they should be able to enter into mutually-consensual agreements concerning the use of the company’s infrastructure. As long as both parties involved agree to the terms, the free market economy supports a company’s right to use their infrastructure. By enforcing net neutrality, the government restricts a company’s right to fully decide how it uses its infrastructure, which in the case of an ISP, includes the allocation of its bandwidth.  Deontology would decree that the government cannot ethically take someone’s property or force someone to use his or her property in a certain way. Because ISPs could no longer form contracts allowing for the prioritization of certain Internet packages, net neutrality prevents broadband providers from allocating their bandwidth optimally, which is a restriction on the use of their infrastructure. Because this infringes on basic property rights, this aspect of net neutrality is unjust from a deontological perspective.</p>

                    <p>When viewing net neutrality from the end users’ and content providers’ perspectives, deontological ethics support a neutral Internet. One of the goals behind net neutrality is to provide equality and freedom of speech through unbiased communication opportunities. In most situations, allowing for ISPs to discriminate against traffic at their desire is unjust. Certain information on the Internet may conflict with the views or interests of ISPs, giving them the incentive to throttle access to that information’s platform. By prohibiting ISPs from slowing or even halting access to such information, a neutral Internet ensures equal access to information and fair communication conditions.</p>

                    <p>Another intent of net neutrality is to provide a neutral playing field, or a space with “levelled access and use conditions, [that avoids] relevant discrimination based on the origin, the nature, the sender or the receiver of a communication” for businesses in a competitive market environment [<a href="links.html">13</a>]. As was done in a 2010 attempt to blackout access to the Fox Broadcasting network, ISPs have a history of fragmenting the Internet into silos, during which time end-users could only gain access to the blacked-out networks through applications not directly in competition with the ISP core business [<a href="links.html">12</a>]. Net neutrality restricts the prioritization or subordination of Internet packages. This restriction prevents the exploitation and extortion of content providers, whose websites and web applications are susceptible to bandwidth throttling from ISPs without such laws. Thus, net neutrality gives content providers an Internet marketplace in which ISPs do not have control of market success.</p>

                    <p>Despite infringement on the property rights of ISPs and broadband providers, the deontological ethical framework would support net neutrality because its underlying intents are overwhelmingly to provide equal access to information and a neutral playing field for businesses.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Conclusion</h2>

                    <p>As both frameworks show, net neutrality has positive and negative ethical implications. In the end, utilitarianism and deontology both support the enforcement of a neutral Internet. Although it may result in some injustices done to ISPs, the positive effects on the rest of the Internet community outweigh those ethical implications. By looking at net neutrality from both perspectives, we can conclude that it would be the ethically sound choice to ensure an open Internet.</p>
