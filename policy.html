                    <h2 class="section-heading">For liberals:</h2>

                    <p>Congress should strike down the Internet Freedom Act. The Internet Freedom Act is a bill currently in Congress that “prohibits regulations adopted by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC).... [to preserve] the open Internet and broadband industry practices from having any force or effect,” which nullifies the FCC’s recent decision. Striking down the Internet Freedom Act is the only solution that truly protects consumers and the digital free market, because ISPs can be regulated like a public utility. After the vote in February 2015 in favor of net neutrality, FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler described Title II (the common carrier classification) as the digital equivalent to the First Amendment, saying that “they both stand for the same concept” of unequivocal freedom of speech [<a href="links.html#8">8</a>]. As the reach and importance of the Internet continues to grow, the United States needs to carefully protect digital speech. Introducing exceptions to net neutrality is like altering the First Amendment to outlaw hate speech&mdash;despite sounding sensible in theory, such restrictions are difficult to enforce, easy to abuse, and ultimately restrict citizens’ fundamental freedoms in exchange for little benefit.</p>

                    <blockquote>Optionally, the "general conduct" rule could be removed. This rule was written in by the FCC to allow them to regulate "whatever they feel like needs regulating," in addition to the aspects they actually defined (throttling, blocking and prioritization).</blockquote>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">For moderates:</h2>

                    <p>Enforce the “no blocking” rule and maintain a minimum service quality tier of 1-2 <a href="terms.html#mbps">Mbps</a>, but allow carriers to differentiate between packets carrying time-sensitive data vs. less time-sensitive data of the same carrier. This does not, however, allow carriers to differentiate between streaming video packets from 2 different companies. An example of time-sensitive data is the data packets needed for real-time conversations on Skype.</p>

                    <p>Such a policy guarantees that there is a standard of service for ISPs, thereby preserving the openness of the Internet. This policy, however, still accounts for the technical complexities of net neutrality by preserving Internet quality for time-sensitive data such as audio or video. By keeping the current infrastructure, network management is maintained without violating net neutrality.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">For consumer protection:</h2>

                    <p>Our third policy recommendations deals with restructuring the FCC to better handle the responsibilities of enforcing net neutrality, as it lacks a department specifically dealing with open Internet issues. The FCC should create an Internet Consumers Division to protect consumers from fraudulent, misleading, and other harmful practices. The new division should investigate the practices of companies, resolve formal complaints, establish guidelines for companies, and consult with internal and external organizations.</p>

                    <p>The budget for this restructuring can be taken from the FCC budget. In 2015, the FCC requested $12,565,000 [<a href="links.html#12">12</a>]. Roughly $1 million of this fund should be appropriated towards establishing an Internet Consumers Division of 5 people. This money can be taken from the $9.2 million specifically set aside for the modernization of the FCC system. After fines are levied against corporations that break net neutrality policies, the new department would be able to recoup the initial expenditure.</p>
